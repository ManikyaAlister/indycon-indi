# indycon-indi

Analysis scripts and data for the indicon-indi project which is looking at whether there are individual and claim type differences in sensitivity to consensus effects. 

- The ``power-simulation`` folder includes scripts for the power simulation which we used to justify the number of trials per participant. 

- The ``data`` folder contains all of the anonymised raw data (in json format), clean data (in .Rdata and .csv formamt), and derived data (various transformations of the clean data). 

- The ``analysis`` folder provides all of the scripts (mainly R, Rmarkdown, or Quarto scripts) used to run the analyses.
