For efficiency I'm running the models in parallel by submitting a separate job for each participant and model combination (defined in job_array.txt). If I didn't do this, it would take much longer to run, since BRMS models can be pretty. slow, and I have a lot of models and participants. For people not familiar with this method though, this could be confusing. 

To make things further complicated (but much faster), I send these models to my university's High Performance Computer (HPC), as it allows me to run hundreds of jobs in parallel, which I wouldn't be able to do locally. This means that my model scripts probably aren't going to run on your machine in their current form.

Instead, you will need to adjust them so that the participant can be accessed. One simple way, would be wrapping each modelling script within a "for" loop.
